# Product Delivery

> The work of **building and shipping** validated solutions to customers reliably and at speed — primarily an engineering / DevOps discipline.

## Why it matters
Discovery decides *what's worth building*; delivery gets it into customers' hands safely and often, and makes outcomes measurable. Weak delivery caps how fast a team can learn and how much it can be trusted with [[empowered-product-teams|empowerment]].

## How it works
Strong delivery rests on the four [[principles-of-product-delivery|delivery principles]]: [[small-frequent-uncoupled-releases|small, frequent, uncoupled releases]] (≥ biweekly, ideally CI/CD), [[instrumentation]] (telemetry to measure usage/outcomes), [[monitoring]] (system health), and [[deployment-infrastructure]] (rollbacks, A/B testing, feature flags). The same team owns delivery *and* [[product-discovery|discovery]] ([[sense-of-ownership]]).

### Why these techniques exist (per [[2022-09-17-moore-changing-how-you-build|Moore, Changing How You Build]])
Three foundational principles underlie the *Build* dimension:

1. **Protecting customers, revenue, brand, colleagues** — modern releases can immediately damage customers and reputation if something breaks.
2. **Responding to market needs** — when something changes (regulation, competitor, customer crisis), you need to diagnose, fix, test, and deploy fast.
3. **Earning the trust of our customers** — customers judge orgs by how quickly and competently they recover; high-integrity commitments depend on the same machinery.

The mechanism that serves all three: **small, frequent, reliable releases.** Smaller release increments make new-capability QA faster, surface regressions sooner, and shrink the search space when something breaks.

## Anti-patterns & misunderstandings
- Treating delivery as a separate "dev team" downstream of a "product team" — breaks [[sense-of-ownership]]; same anti-pattern as a "delivery team" doing what a "discovery team" handed over ([[2020-10-30-cagan-discovery-delivery]]).
- **Big-bang releases** — Cagan/Moore: notorious for delays of weeks/months getting back to releasable state; in many cases the product never reaches solid quality.
- No instrumentation (so outcomes can't be measured); no monitoring (so customers find the bugs first).
- Believing frequent releases lower quality — Cagan argues the opposite; *Accelerate* (Forsgren/Humble/Kim) is the cited evidence.
- **Cargo-culted Agile.** [[2022-09-17-moore-changing-how-you-build|Moore]]: "if your company is still releasing yearly, quarterly, or even monthly, it doesn't matter how many Agile rituals you follow, or how many so-called Agile coaches you may employ, the truth is that you are *not* Agile in any meaningful sense."

## In your context
_Field note placeholder — how often do your teams release, and can they measure and roll back what they ship?_
